  description: Describe layer 2/3 attributes. Primarily CIs used for configuring server interfaces
spec:
  # host_profile inheritance allows for deduplication of common CIs
  # Inheritance is additive for CIs that are lists of multiple items
  # To remove an inherited list member, prefix the primary key value
  # with '!'.
  host_profile: defaults
  # Hardware profile will map hardware specific details to the abstract
  # names uses in the host profile as well as specify hardware specific
  # configs. A viable model should be to build a host profile without a
  # hardware_profile and then for each node inherit the host profile and
  # specify a hardware_profile to map that node's hardware to the abstract
  # settings of the host_profile
  hardware_profile: HPGen9v3
  # Network interfaces.
